  sy-log - shows recent changes
   
SYNOPSIS
  sy log [-x | --exclude-empty] [-n | --database-count=<count>]
         [-s | --database-start=<index>] [-f | --file-count=<count>] 
  
DESCRIPTION 
  This command displays the recent changes to the repository, grouped
  by the corresponding database versions.
  
  By default, the command will display the last 10 database versions
  and their associated files. This default value can be changed by
  the -n parameter. The per-database file count can be changed with the
  -f option (default is 100). To hide potentially empty database versions,
  the -x option can be used.  
  
OPTIONS
  -n, --database-count=<count>
    Adjusts the max. number of database versions to be returned and
    displayed by this command. If this option is not set, max. 10 
    database versions are displayed. To return all database versions,
    set this option to -1. 
    
  -s, --database-start=<index>
    Adjusts the start index of the databases to return. In combination
    with -n, this option can be used for pagination. If -s is not given,
    the first -n databases will be returned. The default for -s is 0.
    
  -f, --file-count=<count>
    Adjusts the max. number of changed files per database version to be
    returned and displayed by this command. If this option is not set,
    max. 100 files are displayed. To return all files per database version,
    set this option to -1.     
  
  -x, --exclude-empty       
    Excludes empty database version from the result. If this option is
    not given, empty databases will be listed as '(empty)'.
